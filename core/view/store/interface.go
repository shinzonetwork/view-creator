// local file systems, cloud storage, GitHub, databases, or remote services.
//
// All methods operate on a view identified by its name.

	// Create initializes and stores a new view with the given name and timestamp.
	// Returns the newly created View.

	// Returns the loaded View or an empty View if not found.

	// List returns all currently stored views.
	List() ([]models.View, error)

	// Save persists updates to a view identified by its name.
	// Returns the updated View.

	// Returns the deleted View.
